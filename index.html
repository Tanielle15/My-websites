<p>My hobby is reading. I could pick up any book and just read for hours. I don't remember when I learned to read But I remember just looking at the books on my second grade teacher bookshelf and sitting down and reading until I was told I had to stop beacause it was lunch. I find so much joy and peace when reading because it takes you mind on a adventure and frees you from the burdens of the real world. I really don't mind if it's online or paperback I'll read the book form the first page to the last page. Not only that because reading is a fundemental skill. It builds vocabulary beings surrouned the words in a book can teach you what they mean and how to use them. It also allows you to be better at schools because all subjects involve reading not just ELA and reading builds you that pratice. Reading is I very important and fun thing that people should really look in to it.
